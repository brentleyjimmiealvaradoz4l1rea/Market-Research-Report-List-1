<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Turboexpander Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Turboexpander</li><li>Axial Turboexpander</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Turboexpander compressors are used in various applications to recover energy from high-pressure gas streams. There are two main types of turboexpanders: radial and axial. Radial turboexpanders have a radial inflow and outflow configuration, making them more compact and efficient for lower flow rates. On the other hand, axial turboexpanders have an axial inflow and outflow configuration, making them suitable for higher flow rates and larger applications. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on specific project requirements.</p></p>
