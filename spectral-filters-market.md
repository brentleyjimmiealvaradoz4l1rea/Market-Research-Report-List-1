<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spectral Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dichroic Filters</li><li>Neutral Density (ND) Filters</li><li>Band-pass Filters</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spectral filters are optical devices used to selectively transmit or block specific wavelengths of light. Dichroic filters are designed to reflect or transmit light at certain wavelengths while reflecting others, enabling color separation or enhancement. Neutral density (ND) filters evenly reduce the intensity of light without affecting its color, allowing for greater control over exposure. Band-pass filters transmit a specific range of wavelengths while blocking others, commonly used in scientific and technical applications. Other types of spectral filters include long-pass and short-pass filters, which transmit longer or shorter wavelengths respectively, and anti-reflective filters which reduce unwanted reflections.</p></p>
