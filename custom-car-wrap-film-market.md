<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Custom Car Wrap Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cast Film</li><li>Calendered Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Custom car wrap films come in two main types: cast film and calendered film. Cast film is made using a more elaborate process where the liquid mixture is spread onto a flat surface and left to cure. This results in a thinner, more durable film that is able to conform to complex shapes and curves. On the other hand, calendered film is made by pushing the mixture through rollers, resulting in a thicker and less flexible film. Each type has its own advantages and is suited for different applications in the custom car wrap market.</p></p>
