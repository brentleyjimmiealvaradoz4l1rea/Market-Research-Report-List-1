<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Diamonds for Jewelry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CVD</li><li>HPHT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Synthetic diamonds for jewelry come in two main types: CVD and HPHT. CVD, or Chemical Vapor Deposition, involves growing diamonds in a laboratory setting using a gas mixture. This method produces high-quality diamonds with impressive clarity and color. On the other hand, HPHT, or High Pressure High Temperature, replicates the natural diamond formation process by subjecting carbon to extreme pressure and heat. HPHT diamonds are typically less expensive than CVD diamonds but may have slightly lower quality. Both types offer consumers a more affordable and ethical alternative to mined diamonds for jewelry.</p></p>
