<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Controlled and Slow Release Fertilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Organic Low-Solubility Fertilizers</li><li>Inorganic Low-Solubility Fertilizers</li><li>Coated & Encapsulated Fertilizers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Controlled and slow release fertilizers market includes organic low-solubility fertilizers, which release nutrients slowly through microbial activity, promoting soil health. Inorganic low-solubility fertilizers release nutrients gradually through chemical reactions. Coated and encapsulated fertilizers have a protective barrier that controls the release of nutrients, ensuring gradual absorption by plants. These types of fertilizers provide sustained nutrition to plants, reducing the risk of nutrient leaching and promoting efficient nutrient uptake, leading to healthier and more productive crops.</p></p>
