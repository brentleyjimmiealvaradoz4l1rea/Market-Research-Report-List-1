<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Full Ice Protection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>De-Icing Systems</li><li>Anti-Icing Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Full Ice Protection Systems Market consists of two main types: De-Icing Systems and Anti-Icing Systems. De-Icing Systems work by removing ice once it has already formed on the aircraft surface, typically through the use of heating elements or chemicals. Anti-Icing Systems, on the other hand, prevent ice formation altogether by continuously heating the surface to maintain a temperature above freezing. Both systems are crucial for ensuring the safety and efficiency of aircraft operation in icy conditions.</p></p>
