<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3-line Breeding Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Type I breeding system is based on using at least three different breeding lines, where the majority of the animals are sourced from one main line. This system allows for greater genetic diversity and reduces the risk of inbreeding. Type II breeding system involves using two main lines, with one line being used for most of the breeding animals. This system may have a higher risk of inbreeding compared to Type I, but can still be effective in maintaining genetic diversity in the population.</p></p>
