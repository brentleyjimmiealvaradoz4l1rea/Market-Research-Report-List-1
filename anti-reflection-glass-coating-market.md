<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Reflection Glass Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Vapor Deposition</li><li>Chemical Vapor Deposition</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-reflection glass coatings can be categorized into two main types: Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). PVD involves the deposition of a thin film onto the glass surface through physical processes like evaporation or sputtering. On the other hand, CVD utilizes chemical reactions to deposit a coating onto the glass. Both types of coatings effectively reduce reflection and glare on glass surfaces, improving visibility and clarity for various applications such as eyewear, camera lenses, and architectural glass.</p></p>
