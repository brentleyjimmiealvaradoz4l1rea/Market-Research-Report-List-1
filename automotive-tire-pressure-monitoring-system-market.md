<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Tire Pressure Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System</li><li>Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>An Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) measures tire pressure by monitoring wheel speed and other vehicle dynamics, providing an estimate of tire pressure. On the other hand, a Direct TPMS uses sensors within each tire to measure actual tire pressure, providing more accurate and real-time data. Both systems play a crucial role in ensuring optimal tire pressure and safety while driving, with Direct TPMS being more precise but typically more expensive than Indirect TPMS.</p></p>
