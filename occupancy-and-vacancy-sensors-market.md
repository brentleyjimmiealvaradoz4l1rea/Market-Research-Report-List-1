<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Occupancy and Vacancy Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Occupancy Sensors</li><li>Vacancy Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Occupancy Sensors are designed to detect when a space is being used by detecting motion, sound, heat, or light. These sensors are used in areas where constant occupancy is expected, such as offices, classrooms, and restrooms. On the other hand, Vacancy Sensors are used in spaces where occupancy may vary, such as meeting rooms, break rooms, and private offices. Vacancy Sensors require manual activation to turn on the lights and automatically turn off when the space is vacant, helping to save energy. Both types of sensors are essential for efficient lighting and energy management in buildings.</p></p>
