<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urban Surveying Airship Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Blimp</li><li>Semi-rigid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Urban surveying airships are commonly categorized into two main market types - blimps and semi-rigid airships. Blimps are characterized by their fully inflated, non-rigid structure that relies on internal pressure to maintain their shape. On the other hand, semi-rigid airships have a partial rigid structure, usually in the form of a keel or internal frame, which provides additional support and stability. Both types of airships are used for urban surveying purposes due to their ability to maneuver in tight spaces and capture detailed aerial imagery.</p></p>
