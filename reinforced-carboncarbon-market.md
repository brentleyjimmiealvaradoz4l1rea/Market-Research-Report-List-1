<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reinforced Carbon–carbon Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Vapor Deposition</li><li>Liquid Impregnation Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) is a composite material used in high-temperature applications, such as spacecraft heat shields. There are two main types of RCC production methods: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and Liquid Impregnation Process. CVD involves depositing carbon onto a carbon fiber preform, creating a strong and lightweight material. The Liquid Impregnation Process involves impregnating carbon fibers with a liquid carbon matrix, resulting in a durable and heat-resistant product. Both methods are crucial in the aerospace and other industries requiring high-performance materials.</p></p>
