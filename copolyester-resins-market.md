<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Copolyester Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Copolyester Resin</li><li>Thermosetting Copolyester Resin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Copolyester resins can be categorized into two main types: thermoplastic and thermosetting. Thermoplastic copolyester resins are materials that can be heated and reshaped multiple times without undergoing chemical changes. They are commonly used in injection molding and extrusion processes. On the other hand, thermosetting copolyester resins undergo a chemical reaction during curing that irreversibly hardens the material. This makes them suitable for applications requiring high heat resistance and dimensional stability. Both types of copolyester resins have unique properties that make them valuable in various industries.</p></p>
