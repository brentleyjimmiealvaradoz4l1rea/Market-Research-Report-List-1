<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile TPMS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automobile TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring System) can be divided into two types: direct TPMS and indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS uses sensors inside each tire to monitor air pressure, providing real-time data to the driver. Indirect TPMS, on the other hand, relies on wheel speed sensors to detect changes in tire pressure based on variations in tire rotation. Direct TPMS tends to be more accurate and reliable, while indirect TPMS is typically less expensive and easier to maintain.</p></p>
