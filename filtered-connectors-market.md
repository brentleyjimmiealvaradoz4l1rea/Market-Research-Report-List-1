<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Filtered Connectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Pass</li><li>High Pass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Filtered connectors are categorized into Low Pass and High Pass filters based on their frequency response characteristics. Low Pass filters allow frequencies below a certain cutoff point to pass through, while blocking higher frequencies. These connectors are commonly used in applications where high-frequency noise needs to be suppressed. On the other hand, High Pass filters allow higher frequencies to pass through, while attenuating lower frequencies. These connectors are typically utilized in applications where low-frequency interference needs to be eliminated.</p></p>
