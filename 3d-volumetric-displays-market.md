<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Volumetric Displays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Swept-Volume Display</li><li>Solid-Volume Display</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Swept-Volume Displays create images by projecting light onto a moving surface, such as a rotating mirror or spinning helix. This movement generates the illusion of a 3D image. Solid-Volume Displays, on the other hand, use a solid medium, such as a glass block or a gel, to create three-dimensional visuals by manipulating light within the medium. Both types of displays offer unique ways to create immersive 3D experiences for various applications, such as entertainment, medical imaging, and advertising.</p></p>
